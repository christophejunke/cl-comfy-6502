TO DO for COMFY-6502

$Revision: 1.1 $ $Date: 2008/03/04 04:18:42 $

- Provide user-interface; compile-code in comfy-tests.lisp is usable
  for testing and development, but a real backend is needed.
- Provide a coherent approach to symbolic arguments. I suspect what
  I have now is about 1/2 sane mixed with 1/2 plain old broken
- Documentation
- Go back and implement JMP elimination and loop-ending optimizations
  Based on my abortive first attempt, I suspect this requires a 
  new class combining both an opcode and an argument; this makes notions
  such as "next instruction" much easier to manage.
- Probably there are similar optimizations available in WHILE
- Fix conditions with subclasses where the :problem string changes.
- Clean out scraps of Baker's macros and examples
